# Softeq-test-tasks

1. Apply CSS styles (red color and black background) to the third paragraph of the following HTML
template

2. Write a program that outputs sequentially the integers from 1 to 99 but on some conditions
prints a string instead:
● when the integer is a multiple of 3 print “Open” instead of the number,
● when it is a multiple of 7 print “Source” instead of the number,
● when it is a multiple of both 3 and 7 print “OpenSource” instead of the number.

3. Find all children of the container HTML element in the following template using native
JavaScript functionality.

4. Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns the sum of the list items that represent an
integer (skipping the other items).<br>
Example:<br>
Input: [‘1’, ‘a’, ‘25’, ‘13.1’].<br>
Output: 26.<br>

5. Write a function that gets JSON from the following link
(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and returns an object with id = 5.

6. Write a regular expression to match strings containing both "Softeq" and "#rules" in any order.

7. Write a function that, when called, returns an array for which each element is a letter of the
alphabet, from "A" to "Z" (exactly once, in order and upper case). Your code cannot contain the
character ' (quote), " (double quote) or ` (backquote).

8. Solve the game "Guess a number", find a secret integer between 1 and 1000000 in less than 50
guesses. Write a function that solves the game and returns the solution by using the function
verify() which is defined with the following specification:<br>

function verify(guess: integer) -> integer<br>

Returns:<br>
● 0 if the guess is the solution, your program won,<br>
● -1 if the solution is smaller than the guessing parameter,<br>
● 1 if the solution is bigger than the guessing parameter.<br>
